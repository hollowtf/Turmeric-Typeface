## Description

Turmeric is the personal output of me, Tom Holloway. Although it's not the first typeface I have designed, it is the first to be release for public consumption. It is a 3-weight family supporting all western, central, and south eastern european latin alphabets containing old-style numberals and discretionary ligatures.
